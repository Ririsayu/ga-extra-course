# Margin VS Padding in CSS

## **Intro**
This article will refresh your knowledge about margin and padding in CSS, it's projected to beginner that's still unsure about the difference between margin and padding.

---

## **So what is margin and padding then?**
The official definition goes like this:
> **Margin** properties are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders. 
> 
> **Padding** properties are used to generate space around an element's content, inside of any defined borders.

To make it a little bit clearer let's say the distance between your skin to other people's skin is called ***Margin*** because it has different parent (body). and the distance between your skin to your bone is called ***Padding*** because it has the same parent (body).

## **Syntax**

Add 10px margin to the top, right, left, and bottom of the element:
> margin: 10px 

Add 10px margin to the top and bottom, AND 20px margin to the right and left:
> margin: 10px 20px

Add 10px margin to the top, 5px to the right, 8px to the bottom and 2 px to the left (clockwise):
> margin: 10px 5px 8px 2px

This one is the same as above but its using individual property:
> margin-top: 10px 
>
> margin-right: 5px 
> 
> margin-bottom: 8px 
> 
> margin-left: 2px

For **padding**, is pretty much the same, you only need to change the "margin" keyword into "padding".

## **Example**

We'll create simple example to better understand the concept about margin and padding.

let's create HTML Structure like this:
```html
<div class="main">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="outer-item">
      <div class="inner-item"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

And initial CSS like this:
```css
.container {
  border: 2px solid #4a47a3;
}

.outer-item {
  background-color: #413c69;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
}

.inner-item {
  background-color: #eab9c9;
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
}
```

Your app will look like this:
![beginning](../screenshots/1_begin.png)
Nothing special in CSS file right now, we just adding border for `.container`, adding width and background color for `.outer-item` and `.inner-item`.


Then let's try adding margin in our css file:
```css
.outer-item {
  background-color: #413c69;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;

  /* Add margin */
  margin: 20px
}
```

now your app should look like this:
![margin](../screenshots/2_margin.png)
Look, I add 20px margin for `.outer-item` and it create spaces around it. Imagine the `.outer-item` push **outside** the top, right, bottom and left of its element to create space.

Now let's add padding to our CSS:
```css
.outer-item {
  background-color: #413c69;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  margin: 20px;

  /* Add Padding */
  padding: 20px;
}
```

Now your app will look like this:
![padding](../screenshots/3_padding.png)
By adding 20px padding, it tells `.outer-item` to push the `.inner-item` 20px from top, right, bottom and left.

**BUT** did you find the behaviour weird ? The element keep getting bigger everytime you add a margin or a padding because the default behaviour is adding the padding and margin into our element.

so in this case element `.outer-item` is calculated to have 200px (width) + 20px (padding) + 20px (margin) = **220px for both width and heights!!**. 

In many case you don't want those behaviour, trust me in this ðŸ˜….

To fix those unwanted behaviour, you could use property `box-sizing: border-box`. Just add this code on the top of your css file:
```css
*, *::before, *::after{
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

Your element will look like this:
![boxsizing](../screenshots/4_box-sizing.png)

This result is the one you probably wanted, because it will not make your element wider or longer by adding margin or padding. 

What `box-sizing: border-box` do is simply include padding and border in the element's total width and height. So it calculated like this **160px (width) + 20px (margin) + 20px (padding) = 200px**.
